# HOW TO USE

1. You will need a list of proxies called "proxies.txt", with one per line.

    For example:

    ```cmd
    123.456.789:1234
    123.456.789:1234
    123.456.789:1234
    ```

2. Open a CMD on the same folder where is located the files, and run the "proxy_filter.py" script.

     ```cmd
    python proxy_filter.py
    ```

3. After check all lines, the script will save the valid proxies on a new .txt file, called "valid_proxies.txt".
